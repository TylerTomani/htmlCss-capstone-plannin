    <h1>ch5 Challenge</h1>
    <p>find "myself", "yourself" and "thyself" and nothing else</p>
    <p>/(my|your|thy)self/</p>
    <hr>
    <p>find "good", "goodness", and "goods" (without typing good more than once</p>
    <p>/good(ness|s)?/</p>
    <p>there is no problem with mixing option with repitition operators</p>
    <p>? is zero or more times</p>
    <hr>
    <p>match "do" or "does" followed by "no" "not" or "nothing"</p>
    <p>/[Dd]o(es)? no(t(hing)?)?/</p>
    <p>another posibility is </p>
    <p style="color:red">/[Dd]o(es)? not(t|thing)?/ <br>
    but this would not return "nothing" because regex is eager</p>
    <p>so switch the "t" and "thing")</p>
    <p>/[Dd]o(es)? no(thing|t)?/</p>
    <p>BELOW, is the most practical solution</p>
    <p style="color:red">/[Dd]o(es)? (no|not|nothing)/
    BUT, notice same problem with regex's eagerness</p>
    <p>so switch it around</p>
    <p>/[Dd]o(es)? (nothing|not|no)/</p>
